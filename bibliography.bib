  abstract = {The article introduces a model for the location of meaningful places for mobile telephone users, such as home and work anchor points, using passive mobile positioning data. Passive mobile positioning data is secondary data concerning the location of call activities or handovers in network cells that is automatically stored in the memory of service providers. This data source offers good potential for the monitoring of the geography and mobility of the population, since mobile phones are widespread, and similar standardized data can be used around the globe. We developed the model and tested it with 12 months' data collected by EMT, Estonia's largest mobile service provider, covering more than 0.5 million anonymous respondents. Modeling results were compared with population register data; this revealed that the developed model described the geography of the population relatively well, and can hence be used in geographical and urban studies. This approach also has potential for the development of location-based services such as targeting services or geographical infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Although smart card fare data has recently become more prevalent as a rich, comprehensive and continuous source of information, there is still some missing information which inhibits its capability in the research field. One key missing piece of information is the passengers' trip purpose. This paper investigates the potential of the smart card data to infer passengers' trip purpose, thereby reducing the use of the expensive and time-consuming Household Travel Surveys (HTS). On this basis, an improved model has been proposed, calibrated and validated for trip purpose inference by integrating different data sources, namely: HTS, a land use database, the South East Queensland Strategic Transport Model (SEQSTM), the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, O-D survey data, and most importantly the unique smart card fare data from Brisbane, Queensland. As smart card fare data does not record passengers' trip purpose, the calibration and validation procedures are performed on HTS data. Based on the validation results, the proposed methodology shows a strong capability to predict trip purpose at a high level of accuracy. The results show an overall 67\% correct inference after applying spatial attributes, but the correct inference increases to 78\% after applying temporal attributes. Different trip purposes show different sensitivities to the applied spatial and temporal attributes. Work and home trips have the highest correct inference results, at 92\% and 96\%, respectively. Furthermore, the results of correct inference for shopping and education trips improved after applying the temporal attributes.},

Positioning technologies that serve these devices such as the cellular antenna (GSM networks), global navigation satellite systems (GPS), and more recently the WiFi positioning system (WPS) provide large amounts of spatiotemporal data in a continuous way. Therefore, detecting significant places and the frequency of movements between them is fundamental to understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering user habits without any a priori or external knowledge by introducing a density-based clustering for spatio-temporal data to identify meaningful places and by applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) over the set of meaningful places to identify the representations of individual habits. To evaluate the proposed method we use two real-world datasets. One dataset contains high-density GPS data and the other one contains GSM mobile phone data in a coarse representation. The results show that the proposed method is suitable for this task as many unique habits were identified. This can be used for understanding users' behavior and to draw their characterizing profiles having a panorama of the mobility patterns from the data.},

This article introduces a data-driven approach using transit smart card data to discover where activities are concentrated and why people travel to those regions. Our approach is based on the idea of stays between passenger trips. A stay has an arrival time and a period of time spent in a certain region. The regions where stays are concentrated are called hubs. Coherent clusters of stays indicate human activities such as going to work or short errands. An efficient and robust algorithm is proposed for learning hubs and their activities. Triangulation with points of interest and ticket data validates that activity stays and hub activities satisfy common sense expectations. The utility of the activity hub profiles for urban planners and transport managers is demonstrated by use cases for operational, tactical and strategic goals.},

  abstract = {In recent years, to fix the shortcomings of traditional bus service and meet the diversified needs of passengers, a new type of transit system, the customized bus (CB), has been proposed. However, how to define and mine the CB's demand is still less being addressed. Since the data of bus smart cards can provide more travel information, it makes the mining of potential CB's demand spots more possible, which can be helpful in CB service design. In order to mine the demand spots more scientifically, this paper, for the first time, quantitatively defines the CB demand characteristics and criteria of selecting potential area, and develops a demand hotspots extraction methodology for CB. The methodology solves two issues primarily. One is how to organize massive smart card data and obtain the space-time pattern and mobility of passenger efficiently; the other is how to mix the CB demand characteristics into the method. This demand spots extraction method can generate multi-style maps, including the heat and origin-destination maps, for spatial cluster of CB's demand spots in rational areas in terms of the CB demand characteristics based on geographic information system. By using the bus smart card data in Beijing, China, this paper carries out a case study to validate the method. The empirical data mining analysis shows that our proposed method can define demand spots ideally. Our work can provide a valuable reference for decision makers to design CB system.},

Analyzing urban travel behaviors with big data helps the design in infrastructures and the optimized personnel allocation. Furthermore, travel behaviors are characterized by dynamic at different time and locations, displaying the rule of urban traffic operation. This paper utilizes smart card data in two cities with different geographical features to analyze the temporal\textendash spatial characteristics of urban travel behaviors. More specifically, by creating travel networks based on the pick-up and drop-off stations and the passenger population among these stations, an interesting observation is that the community structure of travel networks owns a metabolic trend and a stable feature simultaneously. The finding shows that the traffic system can be managed in several parts. Moreover, similar mobility patterns exist in some stations, which can be organized and controlled in the same way. Finally, travel behaviors are related to the urban layout and structure, so the distribution of urban areas can be understood better. Experiments provide enlightening insights for policy makers to comprehend the urban travel behaviors, thus improving the rail transit service plans and scheduling strategies.},

This ingredient is sufficient to reproduce several characteristics of the observed travel behavior such as: the number of trips between different locations in the city, the exploration of new places and the frequency of individual visits of a particular location. Moreover, we indicate the limitations of the proposed model and discuss open questions in the current state of the art statistical models of human mobility.},

By using polygon density maps of activity space, we found clear differences between weekday and weekend activity spaces, and were able to observe the growth trajectory of activity space over 17 weeks. In order to reflect the heterogeneous nature of spatial behavior and tweeting habits, we used Latent Class Analysis twice. First, to identify five unique patterns of location-based activity spaces that are different in shape and anchoring. Second, we identify three unique growth trajectories. The comparison among these latent growth trajectories shows that in order to capture the extent of activity spaces we need long time periods for some individuals and shorter periods of observation for others. We also show that past studies using a single digit number of weeks may not be sufficient to capture individuals' activity space. The major activity locations identified using a multilevel latent class model, do not appear to be statistically related to the growth patterns of Twitter users activity spaces. The evidence here shows Twitter data can be a valuable complementary source of information for heterogeneity analysis in activity-based modeling and s simulation.},

We present a method to predict and validate home and work locations of commuters using their public transport smart card data. Existing works rely on statistical techniques to interpret public transport transactions. Our method goes one step further by exploring the underlying repeated travelling patterns between home and work place. It first uses several features extracted from a card holder's ride records (i.e., the length of time that he/she stays at a location; the times he/she visits a place, etc.) to evaluate the likelihood of a location is associated with the card holder's home/work places. Rank aggregation technique is then applied to derive a comprehensive location ranking list. A few top ranked locations are picked out for further analysis, where the travel records between any two of them are arranged as a time series. Spectral analysis is applied on the time series in attempt to identify periodic travelling patterns. The most likely home/work pair is selected based on a proper period and dominant frequency which implies regular travelling activities between the card holder's home and work place. Finally, home and work locations are discriminated based on the assumption that a person goes to his/her work place mostly on weekdays and rarely on weekends. We apply our method on a threemonth Singapore smart card dataset and evaluate the result against a ground truth obtained from Singapore urban planning programme. Validation results show that the proposed method is able to predict meaningful home and work places.},

One-month smart card data and travel behavior survey data in Beijing were integrated to complement the socioeconomic attributes of cardholders.

Commuters were further divided into fine-grained clusters according to their departure time using the latent Dirichlet allocation model. To enhance the interpretation of the behavior patterns in each cluster, we investigated the relationship between the socioeconomic characteristics of the residence locations and commuter cluster distributions. Approximately 3.1 million cardholders were identified as commuters, accounting for 67.39\% of daily passenger volume. Their commuting routes indicated the existence of job\textendash house imbalance and excess commuting in Beijing. We further segmented commuters into six clusters with different temporal patterns, including two-peak, staggered shifts, flexible departure time, and single-peak. The residences of commuters are mainly concentrated in the low housing price and high or medium population density areas; subway facilities will promote people to commute using public transport. This study will help stakeholders optimize the public transport networks, scheduling scheme, and policy accordingly, thus ameliorating commuting within cities.},

These matrices are very valuable for management and planning but have not been validated until now. In this work, we verify the assumptions and results of the method using three sources of information: the same database used to make the estimations, a Metro OD survey in which the card numbers are registered for a group of users, and a sample of volunteers. The results are very positive, as the percentages of correct estimation are approximately 90\% in all cases.},

Processing and analyzing these data open new opportunities in urban modeling and travel behavior research. This study seeks to develop an accurate framework for the study of urban mobility from smart card data by developing a heuristic primary location model to identify the home and work locations. The model uses journey counts as an indicator of usage regularity, visit-frequency to identify activity locations for regular commuters, and stay-time for the classification of work and home locations and activities. London is taken as a case study, and the model results were validated against survey data from the London Travel Demand Survey and volunteer survey. Results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to detect meaningful home and work places with high precision. This study offers a new and cost-effective approach to travel behavior and demand research.},

We searched seven electronic databases in January 2018 and screened 11910 articles for eligibility. Forty-seven studies were included for review. Studies answered research questions about features of or environmental features within activity spaces using a range of spatial and temporal summary techniques. The conceptual challenge of using activity spaces to strengthen causal inference was rarely considered, although some studies discussed circularity, temporality, and plausibility. Future studies should use longitudinal and experimental designs and consider the potential and actual use of spaces for physical activity, and their relationship with total levels of activity.},

  abstract = {In this study we discovered significant places in individual mobility by exploring vehicle trajectories from floating car data. The objective was to detect the geo-locations of significant places and further identify their functional types. Vehicle trajectories were first segmented into meaningful trips to recover corresponding stay points. A customized density-based clustering approach was implemented to cluster stay points into places and determine the significant ones for each individual vehicle. Next, a two-level hierarchy method was developed to identify the place types, which firstly identified the activity types by mixture model clustering on stay characteristics, and secondly discovered the place types by assessing their profiles of activity composition and frequentation. An applicational case study was conducted in the Paris region. As a result, five types of significant places were identified, including home place, work place, and three other types of secondary places. The results of the proposed method were compared with those from a commonly used rule-based identification, and showed a highly consistent matching on place recognition for the same vehicles. Overall, this study provides a large-scale instance of the study of human mobility anchors by mining passive trajectory data without prior knowledge. Such mined information can further help to understand human mobility regularities and facilitate city planning.},

  abstract = {With the development of society and economy, the metro has become one of the essential components of the urban transportation system. Commuting passengers prefer the metro due to its punctual, high speeds and uncongested characteristics compared to private cars, taxis, bus, etc., especially in morning and evening rush hour. So, identifying metro commuters and mining its commuting mobility patterns play an essential role in improving service quality, promoting public transit use, and optimizing operational scheduling. We develop a method to mine metro commuting mobility patterns using massive smart card data. Firstly, we extracted individual daily regular OD (origin and destination) based on spatio-temporal similarity measurement from massive smart card data. The information entropy gain algorithm is used to further identify commuters from individual regular OD. Secondly, the station-oriented commute space model is built from space views. Metro stations are divided into employment, residential, and balanced type according to job-housing function pattern. They are divided into high efficiency, general, and low efficiency type according to commute efficiency pattern. Function pattern refers to the proportional relationship between the residence and employment land use around the rail station. Efficiency pattern is a comprehensive index to measure the commute time and distance. Finally, stations are clustered by the K-means method to determine what type they are. The experiment found that metro commuters accounted for 41\% of the morning peak traffic using smart card data in Chongqing, China. Three typical job-housing function patterns and three commute efficiency patterns are discovered, respectively, and the characteristics of each are mined.},

  abstract = {Understanding the travel behaviors and activity patterns of vulnerable people is important for addressing social equity in urban and transportation planning. With the increasing availability of large-scale individual tracking data, new opportunities have emerged for studying people's travel behaviors and activity patterns. However, the data has not been fully exploited to examine the travel characteristics of vulnerable people and their implications for understanding transport-related disadvantage. This study proposes a methodological framework based on the concept of activity space that enables a comprehensive examination of vulnerable people's spatiotemporal travel characteristics and an investigation of the geographies of transport disadvantage. Using the proposed framework, a case study that investigates the bus activities of the vulnerable population using four-month smart card data is carried out in the city of Wuhu, China. The case study suggests that vulnerable people possess distinct travel behaviors that differ considerably from the mainstream population and that the implications of transport disadvantage, as revealed by the participation in bus activities, vary across different demographic groups and across different spatial contexts. Some of the empirical insights obtained from this study also differ from con\- clusions drawn from previous studies and will enrich our understandings of vulnerable people's activities. Overall, the paper makes two major contributions. Methodologically, the proposed framework can overcome some of the deficiencies of activity space-based approaches for understanding transport disadvantage and contribute broadly to the studies of travel behaviors and activities patterns using individual-level tracking data. Empirically, the study identifies varying spatial and temporal implications of transport disadvantage associated with different vulnerable groups, which could further shed light on public transit planning and service design.},

This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example, ``home'', ``work'' or ``Northwest Health Club''. It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware applications in the dark about their choices.             Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale experiment that collected real users' location data and personally meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence that shapes more complex than ``points'' are required to represent the full range of people's everyday places.},

Mining the smart card transaction data from AFC system brings new opportunities for travel behavior and demand modeling. This study focuses on detecting the home location and trip purposes for subway passengers (cardholders), based on the internal temporal\textendash spatial relationship within multi-day smart card transaction data. A center-point based algorithm is proposed to infer the home location for each cardholder. In addition, a rule-based approach using the individual properties (home location and card type) of cardholders and the travel information (time and space) of each trip is established for trip purpose identification. The smart card data from Beijing subway in China is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Results show that 88.7\% of passengers' home locations and four types of trip purposes (six subtypes) can be detected effectively by mining the card transaction data in one week. The city-wide home location distribution of Beijing subway passengers, and travel behavior with different trip purposes are analyzed. This study provides us a novel and low-cost way for travel behavior and demand research.},
